Explore a Gazebo simulation featuring drone people avoidance using ArduPilot, ROS (Noetic), MiDaS and YOLOv8. Witness the integration of advanced algorithms and computer vision as the drone navigates dynamically through people in a simulated environment. After the drone has detected and estimated that a person is too close to it, the control algorithm presents two possible courses of action:

1. **Drone stops and the individual moves away**

After the person has moved, the control algorithm incorporates a waiting period to observe whether the person exits the frame. If the person is no longer present, the UAV proceeds along its designated path.

2. **The UAV halts and the person does not move away**

The UAV identifies an individual and comes to a halt. If the subject remains stationary, the drone initiates a sequence where it ascends to a predefined safety altitude and subsequently hovers directly over the person towards the waypoint it was previously following.
